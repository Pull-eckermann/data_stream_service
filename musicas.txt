# Californication from Red Hot Chili Peppers
Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world
And all of Western civilization
The Sun may rise in the East
At least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: Is this your chin
Or is that war you're waging?

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Well, everybody's been there
And I don't mean on vacation

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test
But this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

# Hotel California from Eagles
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead, in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood, in the doorway
I heard the Mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
(Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes-Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the captain
Please, bring me my wine
He said: We haven't had that spirit here since
Nineteen sixty-nine
And, still, those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise
(What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
Relax, said the night man
We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave

# California Gurls from Katy Perry
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You can travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Sex (sex) on the beach
We got sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

You can travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh

Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh

Tone, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean, like, she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak, she drives a jeep
In Laguna Beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay, just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, with kinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the King and the Queenie
Katy, my lady (yeah?), lookie here, baby (uh-huh!)
I'm all up on ya, 'cause you're representin' California

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot

# California Love from 2Pac
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'

[Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild West
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoons
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for
Californ-I-a

California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it baby
Shake, shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

[2Pac]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution: We collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grands
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside
So you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L. A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!

California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'

Now make it shake

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it baby
Shake, shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake, shake it Cali
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it Cali

Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, yeah, Frisco

And you know L.A. up in here
Pasadena where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?

Throw it up ya'll, throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this West Side
Cause you and I know it's tha best side

Yeah, that's right
West coast, west coast
Uh, California Love
California Love

# Going To California from Led Zeppelin
Going To California
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the Sun began to awake (watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods got a punch on the nose
And it started to flow, I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings: La-la-la-la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Trying to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems

# California from U2
Bar-bar-barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-bar-barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-bar-barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-bar-barbara, Santa Barbara

California
Then we sail into the shinning sea
The wind that drags your heart down
Well, that's what took me where I need to be
Which is here, out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California
At the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does

Whoa, oh, all I know
And all I need to know is
There is no, yeah, there is no end
To love
I didn't call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone's a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay

In your bedroom, in a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California
The blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself, there's no end to grief
That's how I know
Whoa, that's how I know
And why I need to know
If there is no, if there is no end
To love

Whoa, oh, all I know
And all I need to know is
There is no, yeah, there is no end
To love
Whoa, oh, all I know
And all I need to know is
There is no, yeah, there is no end
To love
Whoa, we come and go
But stolen days you don't get back
Stolen days are just enough
