### Start to transmit music lines

Psychic spies from China

Try to steal your mind's elation

And little girls from Sweden

Dream of silver-screen quotation

And if you want these kind of dreams

It's Californication



It's the edge of the world

And all of Western civilization

The Sun may rise in the East

At least it settled in a final location

It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication



Pay your surgeon very well

To break the spell of aging

Celebrity skin: Is this your chin

Or is that war you're waging?



First born unicorn

Hardcore soft porn



Dream of Californication

Dream of Californication



Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world

Be my very own constellation

A teenage bride with a baby inside

Getting high on information

And buy me a star on the boulevard

It's Californication



Space may be the final frontier

But it's made in a Hollywood basement

And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres

Singing songs off Station to Station?

And Alderaan's not far away

It's Californication



Born and raised by those who praise

Control of population

Well, everybody's been there

And I don't mean on vacation



First born unicorn

Hardcore soft porn



Dream of Californication

Dream of Californication

Dream of Californication

Dream of Californication



Destruction leads to a very rough road

But it also breeds creation

And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar

They're just another good vibration

And tidal waves couldn't save the world

From Californication



Pay your surgeon very well

To break the spell of aging

Sicker than the rest, there is no test

But this is what you're craving
